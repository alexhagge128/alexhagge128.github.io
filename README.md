# pingpongnumbergame

by Alex Hagge

This is a class exercise dubbed Ping Pong. It is a simple application that I created that takes a number value input and will return a list of numbers starting from 1 to the set value the user entered. Depending on the values listed, they will either say PING, PONG, or PINGPONG depending if they are divisble by 3, 5 or 15.
